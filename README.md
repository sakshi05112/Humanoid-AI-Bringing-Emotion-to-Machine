# 🤖 AI Assistant with Animatronic Eyes

This project is an intelligent AI-powered assistant integrated with 3D-printed animatronic eyes that mimic human emotions and communicate through speech. The system combines hardware (Arduino + servos) and software (Python + speech processing) to create a lifelike, expressive, and interactive assistant.

## 👁️ Key Features

- 🎭 **Emotion Display**: Eyes can express emotions like happy, sad, surprised, angry, and curious through movement and eyelid control.
- 🧠 **AI Assistant**: Responds to voice commands using natural language processing.
- 🔊 **Human-like Speech**: Uses text-to-speech to talk back with a lifelike voice.
- 🔄 **Serial Communication**: Python communicates with Arduino over serial to control servos.
- 🧩 **Custom 3D Printed Eyes**: Designed and printed for a realistic human-eye appearance.
